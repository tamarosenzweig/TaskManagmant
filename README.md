## Development server

To install the app in your computer you have to:
  1. Run the `mySql` code. [my-sql-script.md] (To see some data in the live demo, you should add data to your tabels or run the data- script code.)
     *don't forget to run the `xampp` before using this app.* 

  2. Run the `back-end` project. This is the server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4722/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any     of the source files. The details on the server you can see also in the `environments` file  in the angular app, or in the `app config` file   in the cs project (win form) in the `appSetting` attribute.

  3.  Run `ng serve` for a dev server, if you want to run the angular project. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically     reload if you change any of the source files. Or just run the `cs` project.
